Provides an interface for applying operators to groups of similar objects.

# Extended Description

A standard model for a time-dependent system with an unknown ``x^k`` at time step ``k`` is
```math
\begin{aligned}
x^k &= f(x^{k-1}), \\
y^k &= h(x^k),
\end{aligned}
```
where ``f`` transitions the state to a new time and ``h`` create an observation ``y``.

Ensemble-based methods solve the problem of estimating the state based on observed data by
simulating multiple guesses for ``x`` and updating them to reflect the observed data.

For an ensemble ``X = \{x_1, \ldots, x_N\}`` with ``N`` members, there are three main
computational steps,

```math
\begin{aligned}
X^k &= \{f(x^{k-1}_1), \ldots, f(x^{k-1}_N) \},\\
Y^k &= \{h(x^k_1), \ldots, h(x^k_N) \}, \\
X^k_{new} &= \text{assimilate}(X^k, Y^k, y^*_0).
\end{aligned}
```

Computing ``X^k`` from ``X^{k-1}`` and computing ``Y^k`` from ``X^k`` can trivially be
decomposed into ``N`` independent computations, making parallelization trivial. The
`assimilate` step uses all the ensemble members and can be one of many algorithms,
such as the ensemble Kalman filter.

This package provides an interface for working with this problem.

The two features of this package are:

1. Support trivially parallelizing operators that apply to each ensemble member independently.
2. Provide a common interface for ensemble-based data assimilation algorithms.

Once the operators ``f`` and ``h`` have been implemented for a single ensemble member, any
ensemble-based data assimilation algorithm can be applied to the problem and easily compared
with another.
